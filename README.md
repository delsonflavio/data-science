Diabetes mellitus remains a global health issue, causing several thousand people to die each day from this single condition. Finding and avoiding diabetes in the earlier stages can help reduce the risk of serious health issues such as circulatory system diseases, kidney malfunction, and vision loss. 

The goal of this project was developing a predictive model for effectively detecting potential Diabetes cases, ideally, before commencing preventive treatment.
