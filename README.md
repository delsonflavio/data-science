Hello! My name is Delson, and I have many years of experience with technology and projects in general. Here you will find examples of projects with public data, from exploratory data analysis to machine learning models.

## Projects
### 1. [Predicting Potential Diabetes Cases](diabetes-prediction/)
#### Background
Diabetes mellitus remains a global health issue, causing several thousand people to die each day from this single condition. Finding and avoiding diabetes in the earlier stages can help reduce the risk of serious health issues such as circulatory system diseases, kidney malfunction, and vision loss. 

The goal of this project was developing a predictive model for effectively detecting potential Diabetes cases, ideally, before commencing preventive treatment.

#### Tools
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## Skills
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Machine learning (classification, regression, clustering)
- SQL and relational databases
- Powerbi
- Spreadsheets in general (excel and google sheets)
- I'm committed to the purpose and delivery of projects.
