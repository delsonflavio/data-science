The dataset contains diagnostic measurements that are associated with diabetes, which were collected from a population of [Pima Indian women](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). The data includes various medical and demographic attributes, making it a well-rounded resource for predictive modeling.

The columns and Data Types are as follows:

- Pregnancies Type: Numerical (Continuous) Description: Number of times the patient has been pregnant.
- Glucose Type: Numerical (Continuous) Description: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
- BloodPressure Type: Numerical (Continuous) Description: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- SkinThickness Type: Numerical (Continuous) Description: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
- Insulin Type: Numerical (Continuous) Description: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- BMI Type: Numerical (Continuous) Description: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction Type: Numerical (Continuous) Description: A function that represents the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
- Age Type: Numerical (Continuous) Description: Age of the patient in years.
